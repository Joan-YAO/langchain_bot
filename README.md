I developed a chatbot using the Langchain framework, featuring Ollama's open-source LLM (llama2 uncensored) for robust language processing.
The project employs Prompt Template for structured prompts and Output Parser for clear response formatting. 
The user-friendly interface is built with Streamlit UI, while Langchain manages interaction and workflow coordination seamlessly.
